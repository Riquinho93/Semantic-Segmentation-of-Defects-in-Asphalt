# Semantic Segmentation of Defects in Asphalt

## Abstract

Timely repair of defects present on road asphalt is an important task to increase the comfort and safety of road users. In addition, it allows to avoid intense levels of wear on the asphalt, which also result in higher repair costs. The objective of this work is to construct a defect recognizer in digital images of asphalt by means of Deep learning that has an important function of solving image classification problems.  A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used for its construction. The neural network addressed in this work was U-Net. It enabled IoU 0,9482.
